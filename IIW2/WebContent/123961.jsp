		The University of Southern California (known as USC or SC) is a private, not-for-profit, nonsectarian, research university founded in 1880 with its main campus in Los Angeles, California. As California's oldest private research university, USC has historically educated a large number of the region's business leaders and professionals. In recent decades, the university has also leveraged its location in Los Angeles to establish relationships with research institutions throughout Asia and the Pacific Rim. Reflecting the status of Los Angeles as a global city, USC has the largest number of international students of any university in the United States. In 2011, USC was named among the Top 10 Dream Colleges in the nation. As of 2011, USC enrolls 17,414 students in its four-year undergraduate program. USC is also home to 20,596 graduate and professional students in a number of different programs, including business, law, social work, and medicine. The university has a "very high" level of research activity and received $560.9 million in sponsored research from 2009 to 2010. USC sponsors a variety of intercollegiate sports and competes in the NCAA Pacific-12 Conference. Members of the sports teams, the Trojans, have won 96 NCAA team championships, ranking them third in the nation, and 361 NCAA individual championships, ranking them second in the nation. Trojan athletes have won 287 medals at the Olympic games (135 golds, 87 silvers and 65 bronzes), more than any other U.S. university. If USC were a country, it would rank 12th in most Olympic gold medals.

Expenses at USC

MS students need to earn 27-33 credits (about 9-11 courses). Its 27 for EE and CS, i think!

A 3 unit course, for example, is a 3hour / week course for a 15 week semster.
Cost: $1129/unit.

Mandatory fees $1200 p.a.
Books $150/course.

Now lets take an example of a student for MS CS ---> reqd units=27.

A sample distribution of units for him -->
Cost (Tution+Fees+Books)
Year 1, Fall Semester = 6units 6674+600+300 = $7,674
Year 1, Spring Semester = 9units 10161+600+450 = $11,211
Year 2, Fall Semester = 9units 10161+600+450 = $11,211
Year 2, Spring Semester = 3units 3389+600+450 = $4139

Total for Year 1 = $18,885
Total for Year 2 = $15,350

Total program cost = $34,235

Some facts:
---------------
1) On campus jobs available in plenty at USC costing $5-$20/hour (20hr/week)
2) You can do off campus jobs after the first 9 months (20hr/week)
3) You can do full time off campus jobs(internships) in summer semester (3-4 months). These jobs pay $3k-4k per month.
4) If you have only one course(3 units) remaining in the last semester(Year 2 Spring) then you are allowed to work full time(internship)!!!!
(I was not aware of this fact. Was any of you??)
5) Most graduate students live off campus. Charges of living per month are $375-$450 per month on sharing basis. Its inclusive of all the expenses. (Source: FAQ at http://uscais.org/)
6) Only 5% of MS students get aid.(Almost impossible!)

My analysis:
---------------
Total program cost = $34,235
Cost per year = $17,118
Cost of Off campus housing = $5000-6000 p.a.
(Includes rent, cost for groceries et al.)
Earnings from an On campus job(which you will surely get unless you are really dumb) = $5000-$6000p.a. (By conservative estimates, Considering a job of only $5-6 per hour)
Total cost of one year = 17k+6k = 23k
Lets add some unforseen expenses of 2k.
Total expenses = 25k p.a.
Earnings from on campus job = 5k
Total Amount required = 25k - 5k = 20k p.a.

This is the total amount required if you stay off campus and you work on campus.

Now you can work for about 7-8 months full time (summer+last semster)
Lets say you could only work for about 3 months
So, earnings @ 3k-4k per month = 10k
But during this period you wont be doing any on campus job.
So, total resultant earnings = 10k-1.5k=8.5k
So, total cost for two years = 20k*2-8k=32k=Rs 14.1 lacs
(Even if you skip the internship, the expenses are 40k = Rs 17.6 lacs )
You can avail an education loan of Rs 20 lacs!!! :)

Who the hell says USC is expensive!!!

The above given amount is considering you live off campus, you earn a paltry sum of $5-6 per hour and you do internships for only 3 out of possible 7 months.

Also i have included the costs of books required in the expenses. Most of us will bring the 'Eastern Economic Editions' of the books from India!(which costs one-tenth !! )
